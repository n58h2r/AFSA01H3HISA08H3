Africa in the World: An Introduction
Fall 2024
Course Description:
This interdisciplinary course will interrogate the ways in which Africa is often conceptualized through a Western lens as the ‘dark continent’, perpetually amidst political crisis, humanitarian disaster, famine, violent ethnic conflicts, and chronic underdevelopment. The aim of this course is to introduce students to the study of Africa from an historically-rooted, contemporary perspective, to raise questions about African contributions to the history of humanity. We will engage in a wide range of themes to holistically look at African philosophical thought, political traditions, cultures, languages, state structures, national identity, political economy, and commerce to enable students to develop their reflective intellectual understandings of Africa outside the Eurocentric gaze. Topics will be presented through interactive lectures, class discussions, audiovisual technologies, and case studies.
Learning Outcomes:
At the end of this course, through critical readings of the literature as well as lectures, class discussions, oral presentations, and written work, the student will have achieved the following:
•   An understanding of the nuances of contemporary Africa and her place in the world within the field of African studies
•   An understanding of the ways in which histories of slavery, colonization, and racial violence continue to shape Africa today
•   Improved critical thinking as well as oral and written communication skills
Required Readings:
There is no textbook for the course. All course readings are posted on Quercus, along with class assignments and announcements. Students are expected to read at least one class reading before coming to class each week.
Evaluation and Grading:
Participation (10%) – Your thoughtful participation in class is an important part of the learning process, both for yourself and others – including your instructors! You should come to class and assigned tutorial prepared to engage in an intelligent and thoughtful discussion of the course material. Regular attendance is obviously necessary – but is not sufficient – for participation. Students who are rude or disrespectful to their peers, the teaching assistants, or the professor will have points deducted  from their participation mark. Disrespectful behaviour includes texting, surfing the net, etc. in class.
Critical Reflection paper (20%) - Students will be required to write a 4- to 5-page critical reflection paper on one of the assigned readings. Analyze the ways in which the author articulates the subject matter and how that contributes to your understanding of the African traditional thoughts and philosophies. Analyze why this topic is important in the study of Africa and her peoples from your own understanding. Engage the article and articulate your arguments well. Raise some key questions in your paper. Provide a short conclusion. Reflections will be graded based on synthesis, interpretation, and analysis of the readings.
Length: 1,000 words max. The last day to submit this essay is Wednesday, October 2,2024.
Midterm (30%) – There will be a midterm test based on readings, lectures, and class discussion. More details will be provided in class prior to the test.

Respect – A primary objective of this class is to expose you to different theories in economics and diverse perspectives on development. These are inherently controversial topics, and I encourage respectful and thoughtful debate on the subject matter. This will require you to be open-minded to different perspectives and willing to question your personal convictions. I strive to create an environment in which all students feel comfortable sharing informed insights on the subject matter. Put- downs, snide remarks, and other rude behaviours will not be tolerated.

You may create audio recordings of the class sessions for your personal use, but please ask for my permission in advance of each class.
